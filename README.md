Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is systematic application of engineering principle,methods, and tools to devolope and maintainance of software.
Software engineering is important to the technology industry because it enables the creation of software application in entertainment, commerce, and healthcare.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Development of programming languages such as Fortran and C
In the 1950's is when the software engineering was established as a desciple
Advent of structured programming was established in the  1970's while the rise of agile methodologies in the 2000's

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements:- gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements
Design:- creating high-level and detailed designs of software architecture and user interface
Implementation:- Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications
Testing:-conducting  various tests to ensure the software meets quality starndards and functional requirements
Deployment:- release the software to users of customer
Maintanance:- providing ongoing support updates and enhancements to the software after deployment

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall:- this is done in a sequential approach with distinct phases e.g requirements,design,implementation flowing downwards like a waterfall
Agile:- this is done by herative and incremental approach focust on flexibility, collaboration, and responding to change

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer:- are responsible for writing code and implementary software solutions
Quality Assurance Engineer:- ensures that software quality by designing and executing test plans
Project Manager:- they oversee the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
They help enhance productivity, collaboration, and code quality by providing developers with features such as code editors, version control, Debugging tools, and automated testing capabilities.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Some common challenges faced by software engineers are  changing requirements,tight deadlines,technical debt and this is how they how they overcome this challenges by effective communication, agile methodologies,regular  reasement of project goals,timelines and prioritization of taks.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing is testing individual components or modules of software
Intergration testing is testing interactions between different components orsubsystems
Systems testing is testing the entire software system as a whole
Acceptance testing is testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets users needs
Importance of testing is that its a critical aspect of Quality Assurance since it involves various testings

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is crafting questions or statements to get best possible  responses from AI models
Prompt engineering makes it easy for users to get clear and relevant results in the first prompt

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved 
"Is that grey?" is a vague prompt but " Is that a grey shirt on the bed?" the improved question is more clear,specific and concise because it is specific about what you are asking and where it is
prompt is more effective.
When the questions are clear and specific
